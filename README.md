## 🎯 Concept

In **Path of Duality**, your mission is simple yet profound: **Maintain Balance** on floating islands influenced by "good" and "evil" forces.

- **Red Spheres** 🟥 add weight to the island, tipping it toward imbalance.
- **Green Spheres** 🟩 lift weight, countering the red spheres’ effect.
- **Player Sphere** 🔵 represents you, sliding and struggling to stay on balance!

🔄 **Objective**: **Balance each island** by consuming all red and green spheres before they tip the island too far! Keep the balance meter steady or risk falling into the void!

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic 3D Environment** 🌍: Developed using **React** and **Three.js**.
- **Physics-Based Gameplay** ⚙️: Incline and gravity effects make gameplay challenging and engaging.
- **Score Tracking** 🎲: Keep track of how many islands you’ve balanced before losing!
